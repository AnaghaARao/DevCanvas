      <h2>Why choose devcanvas?</h2>
      <p>
        Accurate, up-to-date documentation is crucial for software success but
        often neglected.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our tool auto-generates documentation, keeping it in sync with your
        codebase and eliminating the need for manual updates.
      </p>
      <p>
        This enhances accuracy, accelerates development cycles, improves team
        collaboration, and provides stakeholders with real-time insights, making
        documentation a powerful driver of efficiency and innovation, not an
        afterthought.
      </p>
