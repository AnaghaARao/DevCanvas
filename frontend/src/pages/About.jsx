          Welcome to our platform!
          <br /> Weâ€™re passionate about making software documentation easy,
          accurate, and always up-to-date.
          <br /> Our mission is to empower developers, teams, and organizations
          by automating the documentation process, ensuring that it grows
          alongside your codebase.
          <br /> By streamlining this essential aspect of development, we reduce
          manual effort, increase precision, and improve collaboration. <br />
          Join us on our journey to make code documentation a seamless and
          integral part of software development.
